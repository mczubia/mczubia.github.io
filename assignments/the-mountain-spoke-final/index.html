            <p class="content">"Fast and friendly customer service. Visited the shop because my new bike was in need of an alignment and they were able to fix it the same day. Prices are very competitive and I even got a 10% off coupon by signing up to their newsletter. I would definitely be coming back not only for repairs but to participate in one of their summer tours." <br> ~Karen H. from New York</p>
        
             <p class="content">"A bike tour is a must on everyone's bucket list. I have always wanted to go but was hesitant because I don't have a lot of experience but I found a beginners tour and decided to give it a try. It was an amazing experience being able to enjoy nature and at the same time fulfilling one of my dreams."<br> ~Doug B. from Arizona</p>
        
         <p class="content">"My dear mother passed away two years ago from Cancer. Our family wanted to honor her memory so we signed up for the Cancer Research Marathon last year. It was an unforgettable experience to come together with cancer survivors and families of loved ones who passed away and contribute even a little bit towards the fight against cancer." <br>~Susan W. from Montana </p>
